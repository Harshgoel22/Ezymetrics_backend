## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    - git clone your-repo-url
    - cd your-project-folder
2. Install the dependencies:
    - npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the required environment variables (refer to the Environment Variables section).

## Environment Variables
Make sure to configure the following variables in your .env file:
  - MONGODB_URL = your-mongodb-connection-string
  - MAIL_HOST = your-mail-host
  - MAIL_USER = your-mail-user
  - MAIL_PASS = your-mail-password
  - MAIL_PORT = your-mail-port

3. ETLQuery:
    - Generates a report by querying the leads and campaign tables.
    - Report: Total number of leads grouped by campaign and city.
4. generatePDF:
    - Converts the report schema into a PDF and provides a download option.
5. generateCSV:
    - Converts the report schema into a CSV and provides a download option.

## Routes
1. GET /storage/fetchData:
   - Fetches the data from the external source.
   - URL: https://localhost:300/storage/fetchData
2. POST /storage/sendDataToDb:
    - Sends new data to the MongoDB database.
    - URL: https://localhost:300/storage/sendDataToDb
3. POST /storage/generateInsights:
    - Generates a report with the total number of leads grouped by city and campaignId.
    - URL: https://localhost:300/storage/generateInsights
4. POST /reporting/generatePDF:
    - Generates a PDF report from the schema and allows it to be downloaded.
    - URL: https://localhost:300/reporting/generatePDF
5. POST /reporting/generateCSV:
    - Generates a CSV report from the schema and allows it to be downloaded.
    - URL: https://localhost:300/reporting/generateCSV

## Utility Function
1. mailSender(email, title, body):
    - Sends an email when either the PDF or CSV report is downloaded successfully.
    - Parameters:
        - email: Recipient email address
        - title: Email subject
        - body: Email content
    - Usage: Notify users of successful report generation via email.
  
## How to Start
1. Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible through the connection string in the .env file.
2. Run the following command to start the server:
    - node app.js
3. If you are using nodemon (for auto-restarts during development), start with:
    - npx nodemon app.js
4. The server will start at:
    - http://localhost:300/
